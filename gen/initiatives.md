# Initiatives

An _initiative_ is a collection of one or more milestones that, taken together, address one or more themes. Initiatives map to major projects that the Taskcluster team would like to accomplish, and can be either new functionality or substantial reworks of existing functionality. Depending on the project area, an initiative can be a thin wrapper around a single milestone if that milestone is high value and self-contained.

The following are the current initiatives:

* [Artifact Integrity](#artifact-integrity)
* [Automatic rebuilding of worker machine images](#automated-worker-image-builds)
* [Implement the Github Checks API](#checks-api)
* [Automatically deploy config changes to community-tc](#community-tc-deployment)
* [Move frequently-updated complex configuration out of the deployment config and into the API](#config-in-api)
* [Decommission docker-worker](#decom-docker-worker)
* [Implement the Object Service](#object-service)
* [Support private taskcluster deployments](#private-deployments)
* [Implement projectId](#project-id)
* [More secure, well-documented process for interactive tasks](#secure-interactive-tasks)
* [Streamline service deployment configuration](#service-deployment-streamlined)
* [Implement taskQueueId](#task-queue-id)
* [Help users construct taskcluster.yml](#taskcluster-yml-helper)
* [Use SOPS instead of password-store](#use-sops)
* [Better worker capacity estimates](#worker-capacity-estimates)
* [Use worker-runner everywhere](#worker-runner-everywhere)
* [Structured Logging for Workers](#worker-structured-logging)

## automated-worker-image-builds
*Automatic rebuilding of worker machine images*

Cloud based workers include references to virtual machine images, which comprise of:

  * a host operating system
  * a worker implementation (e.g. docker-worker or generic-worker)
  * dependencies of those tools (e.g. virtual audio/video drivers, special kernel version, ...)
  * other runtime taskcluster dependencies (taskcluster-proxy, livelog, worker-runner, ...)
  * for workers that run tasks directly on host: worker-pool specific tools and toolchains

Worker Manager cloud-based worker pools are associated to an image, or to a set of machine images (for clouds where a unique image per region is required). Several worker pools can utilise the same image set, so machine images are generally _not_ unique to a given worker pool.
This initiative is about enabling the automatic build of cloud machine images whenever those host definitions change in mozilla/community-tc-config, so that it is no longer necessary for humans to trigger machine builds manually, or modify machine image references in Worker Manager worker pool definitions.
