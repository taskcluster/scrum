automated-worker-image-builds:

  description: >-
    Cloud based workers include references to virtual machine images, which comprise of:

      * a host operating system
      * a worker implementation (e.g. docker-worker or generic-worker)
      * dependencies of those tools (e.g. virtual audio/video drivers, special kernel version, ...)
      * other runtime taskcluster dependencies (taskcluster-proxy, livelog, worker-runner, ...)
      * for workers that run tasks directly on host: worker-pool specific tools and toolchains

    Worker Manager cloud-based worker pools are associated to an image, or to a
    set of machine images (for clouds where a unique image per region is
    required). Several worker pools can utilise the same image set, so machine
    images are generally _not_ unique to a given worker pool.

    This initiative is about enabling the automatic build of cloud machine
    images whenever those host definitions change in
    mozilla/community-tc-config, so that it is no longer necessary for humans
    to trigger machine builds manually, or modify machine image references in
    Worker Manager worker pool definitions.
