# Sprint retrospective - Object Service / Careers Site, November 2, 2020 - December 4, 2020

## What worked
* All of us have worked on this at different levels
  * More input == better product
  * Fewer projects that wither due to lack of ownership/investment
* Team load sharing
  * Flexible and adaptable

## What didn't
* Lack of engagement for sprints when not driving them?
  * Direct ownership of functional areas is appealing, but is it better?
* Planning the work
  * Planning is important and leads to better outcomes
  * Planning can/should involve code
* Do sprints need to involve everyone?
  * No
    * Shorter sprints for fewer people
    * Only involve as many people as required
      * People who aren’t involved can be handling interrupts, high-priority fixes, planning future sprints
    * Would result in more targeted sprints
      * no "filler" epics just to involve everyone
  * Makes working around PTO easier
  * Need to make sure people rotate through sprint involvement to make sure no one is stuck handling interrupts all the time
* Sprints work well once we achieve a certain level of maturity
  * Early work/design requires more singular focus
  * Solidify design decisions that would be challenging to revisit mid-sprint
* Sunk costs vs finding a better alternative?
* Longer slush weeks?
  * More time for investigations
  * Time for digressions is important
  * “Slush week” needs a better name
    * Individual exploration time
  * Accountability is still important
    * What will I _choose_ to work on?
  * 2-3 weeks
* Don’t schedule sprints over big breaks
  * The US Thanksgiving break cut our sprint in two halves
    * We should have seen this coming a ended our sprint *before* the break.

## Process changes for next sprint
* Sprints should be more targeted
  * **ACTION**: don't add "filler" epics just so the whole team has something to work on
  * **ACTION**: not everyone needs to be involved in every sprint
  * **ACTION**: rotate sprint planning & involvement
* Don't schedule sprint over known breaks
  * **ACTION**: pay attention to holiday breaks when scheduling future sprints
