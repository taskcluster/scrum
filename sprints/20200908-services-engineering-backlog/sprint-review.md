# Sprint Review - Services Engineering Backlog, September 8 - September 18, 2020

**Product Owner**: [Coop](/ccooper)  
**Scrum Master**: [Coop](/ccooper)

## Goal
This sprint was chosen primarily for motivational purposes. After a period of low morale following the Mozilla layoffs, the team elected to engage in a shorter sprint to address some epics in our backlog that were either already well understood or that could be clarified to enable future sprints.

### Epics
1. [Azure provider is hardened and simplified](https://github.com/taskcluster/scrum/issues/14)
2. [Upcoming time-sensitive migrations are planned](https://github.com/taskcluster/scrum/issues/15)

## Outcomes
The plan worked as intended. In fact, this was our first sprint where we were able to successfully close all the included issues during the planned duration of the sprint. Go team!

Leveraging [Brian](/imbstack)'s previous work on planning the Azure provisioning epic meant that people were able to jump right back in and make many quick improvements to the Azure provider. This work will assist the Release Operations team as they continue to stand up capacity in Azure.

The migration planning epic also ended up being less work than expected. Again this was in large part due to [Brian](/imbstack)'s effort to meet with stakeholders around the docker hub and some diligent work to update our github app events to avoid deprecation. Of the three migrations that needed planning, only the MLS move required more back-and-forth to reach consensus with Cloud Operations.

## Feedback
Some team members remarked that the sprint felt almost like a "slush week," our term for the downtime between sprints when we often catch up on small backlog items. They felt like they could pick-up other issues or continue with momentum on a current issue. As per normal, they enjoyed pairing with each other as the opportunity arose.

All in all, the team felt that this was a useful and productive way to ease back into day-to-day work.
