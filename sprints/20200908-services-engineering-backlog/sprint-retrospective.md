# Sprint retrospective - Services Engineering Backlog, September 8 - September 18, 2020

## What worked
* Time-based milestone instead of initiative-based
  * This sprint validated that all epics in a sprint don't need to address the same initiative. Provided the individual epics are well-defined and have drivers, we can mix and match epics as needed in a given sprint. This team is responsible for projects other than Taskcluster now, so this is a useful discovery that reflects our changing work patterns. In the future we will likely have both focused and non-focused sprints. Non-focused sprints would be more like slush weeks, whereas focused sprints would tackled coordinated efforts around initiatives. For focused sprints, epics won't get assigned directly to individuals. For non-focused sprints, epics should be assigned to individuals who would act as de facto product owners for that particular epic.
* Effort to better define epics pays off during the sprint
  * Leveraging the planning that had already been done for the [Azure provider epic](/taskcluster/scrum/issues/14) made accelerating into this sprint possible.
 

## What didn't
* External dependencies make it harder to deliver on epics in finite time
  * The specific example here was the MLS migration. We were beholden to decisions from both product management and Cloud Operations. This may be a rationale for keeping some epics outside of sprints, or not putting this type of issue into epics at all. It would instead be a background process that would gate a future epic.


## Process changes for next sprint
* Team should decide whether the next sprint will be focused or non-focused
  * **ACTION**: For focused sprints, epics won't get assigned to individuals. For non-focused sprints, epics should be assigned to individuals
* Factor in vacation when calculating available story points and sprint duration 
  * **ACTION**: Look at PTO calender during planning. Poll team members about upcoming PTO.
